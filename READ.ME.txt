This repository is organized into two main parts: (A) the code used to generate
machine learning models (content 1.1 to 5.2) and then (B) the actual models 
generated by said code (found in folders A through E). 

All of the models are built using different combinations of 12-month data from 
the Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI), the Mullen Scales of Early 
Learning (MSEL), and/or participant biological sex (aka are participants male
or female?). Specific combinations of data used in modelling was informed in part 
by parallel analysis-informed factor analysis as a means of reducing AOSI item-
level data dimensionality. 

The goal of this work was to build on previous research into early screening and
detection of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The primary objectives were to (1) 
conduct a cross-domain supervised learning classifier analysis using 12-AOSI, MSEL,
and demographic data (biological sex), and (2) to assess classifier performance at
predicting 36-month ASD diagnostic outcomes in a cohort of Canadian infant siblings 
at increased likelihood for ASD.  
 
This content represents my work and effort as part of my master of science (MSc) 
degree at the University of Alberta. I felt it important to make this content accessible 
to everyone and anyone as all too often in the sciences will results be presented 
for content that is not made available for everyone to see. As such, in the efforts 
of transparency and better science reporting, I have attached all of the code and 
content I used below. 

Anyone and everyone is welcome to investigate, use, deconstruct, etc. this 
content as they see fit. The only hard disclaimer I will say is this content should 
*NEVER* be used in any clinical capacity; this is research. There is a long way 
to go before predictive ASD diagnostic classifiers are implemented -- if ever. 
Moreover, these models are not built using wholly representative data. As such, 
no clinical, funding, support, etc. decisions should be made using any of the content
that I report here.

Abstract
Background: Growing access to sophisticated computational technology in research 
and healthcare settings has facilitated the use of powerful computer science 
techniques, including machine learning. Though becoming more common in clinical 
and research fields, research into autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has yet to fully
leverage this technology. To date, Bussu et al. (2018) is the only study to have
generated supervised machine learning classifiers using Autism Observation Scale
for Infants (AOSI) data.

Objective: (1) Generation of supervised machine learning classifiers using 12-month
AOSI and Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) data in a cohort of infant siblings
(n=373), and (2) assessment of classifier performance at predicting 36-month ASD
diagnosis in infant siblings from two Canadian longitudinal studies (n=92; n=90).

Methods: Supervised machine learning classifiers using logistic regression (with
and without regularization) and support vector machines using linear, polynomial,
and radial basis function kernels were generated in R/RStudio using combinations
of participant biological sex, 12-month MSEL standard scores (Visual Reception,
Receptive Language, Expressive Language, Fine Motor, and Early Learning Composite),
and 12-month AOSI item-level and Total Score data. Factor analysis (informed by
principal axis parallel analysis) was used as a means of reducing item-level AOSI
data dimensionality during machine learning modelling to mitigate model overfitting.
Classifiers were assessed by their ability to predict 36-month ASD diagnosis in 
subsets of infant siblings (n=92; n=90) from two Canadian longitudinal cohorts.

Results: Machine learning classifiers had fair performance. The best-performing 
classifiers across all algorithm types were between 76-77% accurate and had areas
under the curve (AUC) between 0.73 and 0.76. Specificity of these classifiers was
excellent (0.94-1.0) but they showed extremely poor sensitivity (0-0.19). Relative
to the performance of a 12-month AOSI Total Score cut point of 7 (informed by 
Youden index assessment; AUC = 0.66, sensitivity = 0.52, specificity = 0.74) at 
predicting 36-month ASD diagnosis, machine learning classifiers had enhanced AUC 
and specificity, but significantly decreased sensitivity. The best-performing 
classifiers in this study yielded higher accuracy, AUC and specificity (but not
sensitivity) relative to the best performing classifier generated by Bussu et al.
(2018) using 14-month data (accuracy = 64%, AUC = 0.71, sensitivity = 0.61, 
specificity = 0.67) in a 2018 study using similar machine-learning methodology.

Discussion/Conclusion: Though the best-performing classifiers in this study performed
below levels recommended for early screening, accuracy, AUC, and specificity
were moderately improved relative to those generated by Bussu et al.(2018) using
14-month AOSI data. Further exploration into feature selection, extraction or 
inclusion of 12-month AOSI and MSEL data may allow continued refinement of machine
learning models built using 12-month clinical data and capable of predicting ASD
at 36-months.
